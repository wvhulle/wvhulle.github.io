# Interfaces in C++

I discussed interfaces in Python [here](../../py/03-interfaces)

In C++, this would become

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Organism {
public:
    virtual void eat() = 0;
    virtual void sleep() = 0;
    virtual void reproduce() = 0;
};
```
