## Professional

I am a _mathematician and computer scientist_ from Ghent, Belgium. I attempted physics, but became enamoured with [fermenting bacteria](https://www.inbiose.com/) before finishing. Since 2020, I have worked in scientific and tech start-ups as a software engineer. In 2025, I gathered my experience and taught a [Rust course](https://github.com/wvhulle/rust-course-ghent) for intermediate developers.

In the past year I broadened my horizon to include C++ in my expertise and help companies deal with their large legacy codebases.

For a more complete overview, see my <a href="https://github.com/wvhulle/cv/blob/main/resume.pdf">CV</a>.

## Personal

I organise [SysGhent](https://sysghent.be), an open community for systems programmers. It's a group of people who finished their studies, but miss learning and we do lectures and meet-ups. Life is too short to sit only behind your computer.

I maintain a tool for learning the Nu scripting language: [`nu-lint`](https://crates.io/crates/nu-lint).

- My latest open-source projects are hosted at  <a href="https://codeberg.org/wvhulle">Codeberg</a>
- Recently, GitHub became slow and bloated, but you can still find there at <a href="https://github.com/wvhulle">GitHub</a>
