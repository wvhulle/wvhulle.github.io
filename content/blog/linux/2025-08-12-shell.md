From most-useful to less-useful

## [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)

A fuzzy version of `cd`. A fuzzy search engine for folders in your filesystem. It learns where you want to go through usage. You can even configure it to replace `cd`.

## [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

A replacement for `diff` that adds syntax highlighting and paging. You can configure it as the default diff tool for Git.

## [Git difftool Meld](https://meldmerge.org/)

Not really a shell tool, but you can configure `meld` as the default difftool for Git. You can also add it as a `git` alias, you just have to write: `git meld [BRANCH]` to compare the current branch with another branch.

## [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)

A shell that consciously avoids being POSIX compliant. This may look like a disadvantage, because you can't blindly copy-past Bash scripts from the internet anymore, but that is also the only disadvantage.

- Nu shell has an `rm` command that can be configured to delete files to the trash always.
- It also has an `ls` command that can be queried using a kind of SQL syntax with traditional pipes.

## [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)

Terminal editor with powerful keybindings and language server support out of the box.

## [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/)

A search engine for your shell history that sync between devices. In a sense it is a replacement for the old `history` command.

Beware: By default it hijacks your upper arrow key to suggest commands from your history. However, you make it narrow down to commands within the same Git repository or folder.

## [Oh-My-Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)

Extend your system prompt with extra information (about package version, git status). A prompt that shows me my Git branch and status is essential.

## [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

A replacement for `cat` that adds paging (so you don't have to pipe it through `less`), syntax highlighting, and line numbers.

## [Direnv](https://direnv.net/)

Scaffold system environments by just entering and exiting directories.

## [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

Easy terminal splitting. Detaching from views is possible to keep processes running in the background.

## [Claude-code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

For refactorings in human language.

## [Carapace](https://carapace.sh/)

Aggregator for shell-completers.

## [Broot](https://dystroy.org/broot/)

Pretty file-system trees.

## [NCDU](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)

Analyze which folders use the most disk space.

## [Powertop](https://01.org/powertop/)

See how many Watts your system is using and which processes are consuming the most power.
