## NixOS

It's more than just a service, it's a whole operating system. But it is **great for my memory issues**. I used forget every solution I created for my Linux problems, but with Nix I don't have to remember each solution anymore. I can write operating system solutions as code and track different versions in Git.

## Atuin history sync

Link: [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/)

Interactive search / recommendation / sync system for your shell history.

Beware: By default it hijacks your upper arrow key to suggest commands from your history. However, you can make it narrow down to commands within the same Git repository or folder.

## Wluma

Adjusts your screen and keyboard brightness according to learned preferences. Everytime you adjust the brightness manually and `wluma` is running, it uses this information to adjust the brightness the next day around this time.

You can also use the webcam instead, but this might result in an LED flickering every 5 seconds.

For internal screens, like laptop screens, `wluma` works with minimal configuration. For external screens, you might need a Linux kernel module `ddcii-driver`, udev rules and maybe even create a i2c device.
